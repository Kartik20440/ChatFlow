# ChatFlow
Making a Question-Answering Chat Flow leveraging Knowledge Graphs based on Individual Health Policy documents from HDFC Ergo.

**Running the Code-**
To run the code, you first need to install the dependencies and then run the chatbot.py file once. After running the chatbot.py file, you can run the frontend.py file by the following command- "streamlit run frontend.py," which will open the streamlit-based website for interacting with the chatflow.


For interacting with the chatflow through terminal instead of streamlit website, you can uncomment the last line (chat()) in the chatbot.py file and run the file. It will make an interactive window for you on terminal where you can type your questions and the chatflow will answer them. For closing the program you can simply type "exit" on the terminal and press enter.
